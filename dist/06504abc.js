Footbag Worldwide has been a big part of footbag culture since about \n    two decades, acting as an information source for footbaggers on all levels around the world. We are currently working \n    on a major update of the site. First thing to do is the front page as you can see. Our aim is to bring footbag.org to \n    today and prepare it for the future as well. There is a long way to go, but it’s the beginning!</p>\n\n </news-item>\n\n        </grid-template>\n        <grid-template class="events" header="Events" header-color="red">\n            \n\x3c!--  ADD EVENTS RIGHT BELOW THIS  --\x3e\n <event-item\n    header="IFPA Online World Footbag Freestyle Championships 2020"\n    date="1st June - 2nd August 2020"\n    location="Worldwide!"\n    contact="Wiktor Debski - IFPA Executive Director, wiktordebski@footbag.org, "\n  >\n  </event-item>\n  <event-item\n    header="Swiss Footbag Open"\n    date="March 28-29, 2020"\n    location="Lausanne, Vaud, Switzerland"\n    contact="Karim Daouk, kshred@footbag.org, 0041 79 238 78 87"\n  >\n  </event-item>\n  <event-item\n    header="Bulgarian Footbag Championships"\n    location="Stara Zagora, Bulgaria"\n    date="May 1-3, 2020"\n    contact="Ivan Stanev, navi6venats9@gmail.com, +359883512133, Radoslav Rusev,\n    radoslavrusev@gmail.com, 00359894273320"\n  >\n  </event-item>\n  <event-item\n    header="Mud Belt 2020 presented by Memphis Footworks"\n    date="May 2-3, 2020"\n    location="Moscow, Tennessee, USA"\n    contact="Walt Houston, walthouston7@gmail.com"\n  >\n  </event-item>\n  <event-item\n    header="Lake Erie Footbag Tournament"\n    date="June 6-7, 2020"\n    location="ERIE, Pennsylvania, USA"\n    contact="Anthony Ritz, anthony.l.ritz@gmail.com, 814-431-4139"\n  >\n  </event-item>\n  <event-item\n    header="21st IFPA European Footbag Championships"\n    date="June 11-14, 2020"\n    location="Jaworzno, Poland"\n    contact="Wiktor Debski, wiktordebski@footbag.org"\n    highlight\n  >\n    <p>\n      We are excited to announce the 21st European Footbag Championships in Jaworzno, Poland from June 11-14, 2020! \n      Paweł Nowak, Footbag Freestyle World Champion 2017 (Routines) and 2019 (Overall) in collaboration with Arthur Ledain \n      and Kerstin Adineh from EFC (European Footbag Committee of IFPA) will host this year\'s miscellaneous event and \n      invite you to the beautiful city of Jaworzno in the south of Poland!</p>\n    <p>\n      Qualification rounds for all disciplines in Footbag Net and Freestyle will start in the morning of Thursday, June 11.\n      Finals will be held in front of the local public on Friday, June 12, at Jaworzno’s biggest shopping mall \n      (some Freestyle disciplines) as well as on Saturday and Sunday, June 13-14, within the framework and in the area of\n      the Festival Days of the City Jaworzno at the City Stadium (Freestyle and Net).\n    </p> \n    <p>\n      On the last day of the event Sunday, June 14, there will be some last finals at the city festival, played side by \n      side with a freestyle, mini-net and workshop area for the public to try out and meet the players of the European championships. \n      As an additional highlight, the hosts will show the footbag community some of the most beautiful landmarks of the \n      Jaworzno region with footbag golf and chill&grill for all participants. \n    </p>For the qualification days, there are two main event sites: a sports gym (6 footbag net courts plus additional freestyle area) \n    and a shopping mall (for Freestyle events only). \n    <hr>\n    <p>\n    Detailed information for players about schedule, accommodation, airport and local transfers, site maps and the\n    *official registration* (by early April) will be published and regularly updated at the event’s domain: \n    footbag.online Come and join this event, which is again intended to be more than a tournament, shred and spike \n    hard, hang out, celebrate our beloved sport and its community and spread the passion! \n    </p>\n    <hr>\n     <p>\n      Background information Jaworzno is the 13th-largest city in Poland in terms of area, with almost 100,000 \n      population located in the south of Poland near Krakow and Katowice.
